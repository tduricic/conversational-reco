# Recommender Systems with RecBole
recbole
# torch # RecBole's setup.py will specify a compatible PyTorch version
# scipy # RecBole's setup.py will specify a compatible SciPy version
pyyaml # Often a dependency for RecBole's config handling
lightgbm # For RecBole's external model support (even if not directly run, it's checked)
xgboost  # For RecBole's external model support (even if not directly run, it's checked)

# Specific version for NumPy due to RecBole/Ray compatibility issues discussed (np.bool8 error)
numpy==1.23.5

# Notes:
# 1. It's generally recommended to install these in a clean virtual environment.
# 2. RecBole will pull in its specific PyTorch and SciPy dependencies. If you encounter
#    further issues, you might need to pin PyTorch (e.g., torch>=1.7.0,<1.13.0) and
#    SciPy (e.g., scipy>=1.7.0,<1.10.0) to versions known to be compatible with
#    numpy==1.23.5 and your RecBole version.
# 3. The `bertopic[visualization]` extra should install dependencies like `umap-learn` and `hdbscan`.
#    If not, you might need to install them separately: `pip install umap-learn hdbscan`.
